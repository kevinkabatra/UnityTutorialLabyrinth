### Pixel art
As I am focusing only on programming I decided that I should find some open source images to create my "game art". I found [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org), which is a site that offers just that. Within the site I found an interesting post of some work done by [Hyptosis](http://www.lorestrome.com/pixel_archive/main.htm), Daniel Harris. Some of the pieces I felt would work really well for creating the labyrinth. Luckily his work was released under a [CCO](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license and he only required that I give him the proper credit. What a great dude!

Again, [Dan / Hyptosis](https://hyptosis.newgrounds.com/) thank you very much for your contributions. I also release almost all of my work under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license, so I think it is very important to contribute to the community.
